Each player writes 3 phrases on 3 pieces of paper. The phrases are best if they are nonsensical, abstract, or inside jokes.
All of the papers are places folded up in a bowl and the group is split into two teams. 
For the 1st Round one player tries to get their team to guess as many phrases in 2 minutes by only talking and avoiding the words on the paper or passing. 
Once the player's turn end a player from the other team continues with the remaining words. 
Once all the papers are gone from the bowl, the team that got the most papers wins the round. 

Round 2 is played with the same words but this time the players have to get their team to guess with charades. 
Round 3 is also played with the same words but the players that are trying to get their team to guess can only say a single word. 

I love this game because it's more than just charades, taboo, or codenames because there is a memory aspect.
